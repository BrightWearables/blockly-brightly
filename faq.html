      <p align="left"><a name="what_is_brightly"></a><b>What is
          BRIGHTLY?</b><br>
        Brightly is a CircuitPython code generator for programmable LEDs
        (NeoPixels). It is based on <a
          href="https://developers.google.com/blockly/">Blockly,</a> an
        open-source, drag and drop code editor. BRIGHTLY lets you drag
        and drop simple code blocks to generate a CircuitPython program
        that shows different colors, patterns and animations on an LED
        string. This is not a professional product. It is a project I
        created to help with my programming workshops, which I decided
        to share, hoping others will find it useful. <a
          href="disclaimer">Standard disclaimer here</a>.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="why_is_brightly_useful"></a><b>What makes
          BRIGHTLY useful?</b><br>
        Brightly lets you generate interesting dynamic patterns for LED
        strips with a minimum amount of work. It is a particularly
        useful tool for a non programmer. When coding in Python, correct
        formatting is critical - an errant space or missing colon
        crashes a program. Using BRIGHTLY to generate the CircuitPython
        code avoids formatting pitfalls, and is simply much faster than
        writing code manually.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="what_do_i_need"></a><b>What will I need
          to run a BRIGHTLY generated program on a microcontroller?<br>
        </b>You'll need a microcontroller which runs CircuitPython that
        is connected to a strip of Neopixels on one pin. You will need
        the Adafruit CircuitPython NeoPixel library from the <a
href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases">CircuitPython
          Bundle</a>. You will also need to download the <a
          href="https://github.com/BrightWearables/brightly">BRIGHTLY
          CircuitPython library</a> and copy it to your board. See the <a
          href="instructions.html">BRIGHTLY Instructions</a> page for
        details on what to do with the libraries to make sure your code
        will run.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="why_did_you_create_brightly"></a><b>Why
          did you create BRIGHTLY?</b><br>
        I wanted to run a programmable LED wearables workshop for
        non-programmers, and let the participants change the colors and
        patterns on their creations. Some of the more advanced
        easy-to-use microcontroller boards (<a
          href="http://microbit.org/">BBC micro:bit</a>, <a
          href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333">Adafruit
          CircuitPlayground Express</a>) have a powerful drag-and-drop
        programming interface through <a href="https://makecode.com/">MS
          MakeCode</a>, which works well for novice programmers.
        However,&nbsp; the cheaper CircuitPython controllers (e.g.
        Adafruit's <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3501">Gemma

          M0</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3500">Trinket

          M0</a>) which are ideal for workshops, have no such interface,
        so I thought I'd create one.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="can_brightly_program_elec"></a><b>Can
          BRIGHTLY program electronic accessories other than LEDs?</b><br>
        No. The BRIGHTLY code generator is strictly for creating LED
        pattens and animations. You can run the BRIGTHLY functions along
        with other CircuitPython libraries that control sensors and
        elctronics, but you will need to modify Brightly's generated
        code to do so.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b><a name="what_microcontrollers"></a>What
          microcontrollers does BRIGHTLY work on?</b><br>
        So far, I have tested it on Adafruit's Gemma M0, Trinket M0 and
        CircuitPlayground Express. It should run on any
        CircuitPython-enabled microcontroller that can use <a
href="https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-essentials/circuitpython-neopixel">Adafruit's
          Neopixel library</a> to connect to programmable LED strings.<br>

      <h3 align="left">***The BRIGHTLY code editor***</h3>
      <p align="left"><a name="how_do_i_use_the_code_editor"></a><b>How
          do I use the code editor?</b><br>
        BRIGHTLY will be familliar to anyone who has done drag and drop
        programming. The code blocks, which represent LED colors,
        patterns or functions, are categorized into different menus on
        the left side of the window, called the toolbox. Just click on a
        category to view its blocks. To create code, drag the blocks
        from the menu into the workspace, and place them within one of
        the existing green blocks ("run once at start" or "run forever")
        to add them to your program. It should be intuitve that function
        blocks placed inside the "run once" block will run one time when
        the program starts (i.e. the microcontroller is powered on or
        restarted), and function blocks placed inside the "run forever"
        block will run over and over again in a loop. You will probably
        want to put most of your program in the "run forever" block.</p>

      <p align="left"><a name="how_do_i_download_cp_code"></a><b>How do
          I get CircuitPython code from my BRIGHTLY block program?</b><br>
        Once you have written your program, click the purple "Download
        Code" link, and a file named "main.py" containing CircuitPython
        code will download to your computer<b>.</b></p>
      <p align="left"> <b><a name="can_i_save_code_blocks"></a>Can I
          save my BRIGHTLY program?<br>
        </b>Yes, if you want to save your BRIGHTLY code blocks, enter a
        file name in the "Save Blocks to File" field, and click "Save as
        XML". This will download an XML file to your computer which
        contains instructions to generate the BRIGHTLY program in the
        BRIGHTLY code editor. The XML file is NOT a CircuitPython
        program, and will not run on a microcontroller.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="how_do_i_edit_a_program"></a><b>How do I
          edit a BRIGHTLY program I previously created?</b><br>
        As long as you saved your program as an XML file, you can load
        it into the BRIGHTLY editor by clicking the "Choose File" link
        at the top of the window. BRIGHTLY cannot read CircuitPython
        files, only XML files generated from the BRIGHTLY code
        generator.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="can_i_edit_circuitpython"></a><b>Can I
          use BRIGHTLY to edit CircuitPython code directly?</b><br>
        No. BRIGHTLY can only edit code blocks saved in XML files.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><b><a name="why_14_leds"></a>Why does the BRIGHTLY
          code editor default to using 14 LEDs?</b><br>
        Because I developed it for a workshop making a programmable LED
        headband that has (surprise!) 14 LEDs (<a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JadMgPY26nA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JadMgPY26nA</a>).
        However, you can easily change the number of LEDs by clicking
        the dropdown menu in the "run once at start" code block.<br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <h3 align="left">***Using BRIGHTLY CircuitPython code with LEDs***</h3>
      <p align="left"><a name="what_kind_of_leds"></a><b>What kind of
          LEDs can I program with BRIGHTLY?</b><br>
        BRIGHTLY is designed for single-wire control RGB WS2812-type LED
        strips and strings - (aka NeoPixels), because it depends on
        Adafruit's CircuitPython NeoPixel library. These LEDs are easily
        available from a wide variety of sources. BRIGHTLY will not work
        with APA102-type LED strips (also known as Dotstar).<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="how_many_leds_possible"></a><b>Does
          BRIGHTLY have a maximum number of LEDs?<br>
        </b>Currently the number of LEDs in the BRIGHTLY code editor is
        capped at 36 because some code blocks expand as the number of
        LEDs grows, and it becomes awkward to drag and drop them inside
        the workspace. If I find a way to make the code blocks for large
        number of LEDs less unwieldy, then this will change. However,
        another limit to the number of LEDs comes from memory
        limitations on CircuitPython boards. CircuitPython itself
        requires a lot of memory to run and on smaller boards (Gemma M0
        and Trinket M0) this can limit code size and available memory.
        On boards with more memory, this is not nearly as much of a
        problem. I have encountered no problems creating fairly large
        programs for strings of 14 LEDs. A new generation of <a
href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2017/08/01/the-atsamd51-is-here-adafruit-microchipmakes-atsamd51/">CircuitPython
          boards based on the ATSAMD51 chip</a> will have more memory,
        so hardware will probably solve this problem in the future.<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="how_to_run_on_microcontroller"></a><b>How
          do I make my BRIGHTLY CircuitPython program run on my
          microcontroller?</b><br>
        Please see the <a href="instructions.html">Instructions page</a>
        for details<br>
      </p>
      <p align="left"><a name="what_if_rgbw_leds"></a><b>What if I have
          RGBW LEDs instead of RGB LEDs. Will they work?<br>
        </b>Yes. There is no place to change the type of LED in BRIGHTLY
        itself, but if you open up the "main.py" file and find the
        function call which creates the NeoPixel strip:</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp; strip =
          neopixel.NeoPixel(board.D1, numpix, brightness=0.2,
          auto_write=False, pixel_order=None)</i></p>
      <p align="left">you can change the code to work with different
        kinds of LEDs by changing the word "None" to one of (RGB, GRB,
        RGBW, GRBW) - whichever maches your strip.<br>
